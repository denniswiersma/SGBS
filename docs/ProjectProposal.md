Pipeline to reproduce [Fast-GBS](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12859-016-1431-9.pdf) pipeline.

## Fast-GBS
Fast-Genotyping-by-sequencing is a bioinformatics pipline which makes use of GBS, which itself is a genotyping approach which makes use of NGS to scan a genome.
This technique allows for the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of countless SNPs across a wide range of species.
Fast-GBS attempts to to simplify the process of performing genotyping on the huge amount of data produced by NGS, while simultaneously speeding up this process.
It is capable of handling data from different sequencing platforms and can automatically detect different types of variants.

### Input
Fast-GBS takes a FASTQ file containing sequenced DNA fragments from any restriction enzymeâ€“based GBS protocol as its main input. 
Next to this it also uses a configuration file (referred to as parameter file) which contains processing options as well as file paths.
These paths can refer to the input FASTQ file, a reference genome file, or a file containing barcodes.

### Steps
Fast-GBS uses publicly available packages for its main analysis pipeline, while using internally developed scripts to guide the process and create directories.
The following is a list of used packages and their purpose:
- Sabre -> demultiplexing
- Cutadapt -> trimming & cleaning
- BWA -> alignment
- Platypus -> post-processing of mapping, haplotype construction, and variant calling
