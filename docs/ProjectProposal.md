Pipeline to reproduce [Fast-GBS](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12859-016-1431-9.pdf) pipeline.

## Fast-GBS
Fast-Genotyping-by-sequencing is a bioinformatics pipline which makes use of GBS, which itself is a genotyping approach which makes use of NGS to scan a genome.
This technique allows for the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of countless SNPs across a wide range of species.
Fast-GBS attempts to to simplify the process of performing genotyping on the huge amount of data produced by NGS, while simultaneously speeding up this process.
It is capable of handling data from different sequencing platforms and can automatically detect different types of variants.
